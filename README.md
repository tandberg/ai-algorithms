# AI algorithms
This is a repository including the implementation of some basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms. All the algorithms is written as a standalone program in Python.

## Algorithms


- Expectation Maximation
- Simulated Annealing (comming)
- A* search
- Artificial Neural Network (comming)
- Min-conflicts (comming)
- Minimal Independent Set (comming)
- K-means
- ID3 (comming)
- Evolutionary algorithm (comming)
	- Parent-mate selection
    	- Fitness Proportionate
    	- Sigma scaling
    	- Tournament section
    	- Boltzmann selection
    - Adult selection
    	- Full population Replacement
    	- Over production
    	- Generation mixing

## Usage
Run the algorithms from the command line typnig:

```
python [algorithm-file].py arguments
```

## Python dependencies

- networkx
- matplotlib
